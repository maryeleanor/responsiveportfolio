            After an initial survey, I created a few different concepts for testing. I conducted user interviews with my own sketches and comparative analysis.  I established user personas, use-flows and wireframes for an initial concept. We gathered data through typeform surveys and conducted card sorts to establish the most important home-features and app-features of our users.  I used this data to create the on-boarding, mobile app navigation, wireframes, and a prototype. </p>

_____________________
Ela  |  Web Design 
  Ela is an art cooperative, selling works for charity. My role was to design the ecommerce product, logo and branding for this new cooperative.

Timeline: 4 weeks
Research: surveys, interviews and hands on usability tests 
Artifacts Created: sketches, site flows, navigation, logo, branding, newsletter wireframes, sitemap, web wireframes, and a responsive website  
Tools: Photoshop, Illustrator, HTML, CSS, Javascript
 
  With the initial concept in mind, I interviewed artists, fundraisers and potential buyers to establish user personas and a mental model of the product. I drew raw wireframes to get quick user reaction and feedback.  Armed with some new ideas and the user data, I spent about 3 weeks designing a responsive website, and concept for a tablet and mobile app. I created siteflows, navigation, and wireframes for the both the website and newsletters.  I then created the logo, branding ideas, and complete visual design of the responsive e-commerce site.

  After an initial survey, I created a few different concepts for testing. I conducted user interviews with my own sketches and comparative analysis.  I established user personas, use-flows and wireframes for an initial concept.

Cook Clips  |  Mobile and Tablet App
  Working directly with an entrepreneur wanting to solve a specific problem; I created the concept of Cook Clips.  Cook Clips is a cooking app that you can acutally use in the kitchen. It talks you through your favorite recipes with voice commands, and video clips. Cook Clips breaks each recipe down into steps; helping new cooks follow video tutorials as well as experienced cooks that just need a quick reminder of whats next. 

Timeline: 8 weeks
Research: surveys, interviews, and usability tests
Artifacts Created: content strategy, personas, userflows, sketches, wireframes, app interface, prototype
Tools: Omnigraffle, Sketch, Typeform, Invision

    I interviewed potential users about their cooking habits and app use in the kitchen, and developed a few key problems to solve. The personas varied greatly, and I first concentrated on a concept that meets one major use case.
