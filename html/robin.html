  <h3> Start Exploring, Robin will learn what you're looking for.</h3>
        <p> 
          Working directly with an entrepreneur, I created Robin: a mobile app for Real Estate Listings. Users receive curated home listings depending on their preferences. Through surveys and interviews, I found that most users searching for real-estate were overwhelmed by search results; and had unique criteria about what they were looking for. The want to see what's out there, and not be contacted by agents until they're ready. </p>
          <p class="lead">Robin is a fun, trustworthy agent at your fingertips. </p>
          <p>
          Robin learns what users are looking for and improves the listings depending on user interaction over time. Users can treat the search results like an inbox. Save what they love to custom collections, and ‘delete’ when needed. Listings can be searched or sorted by price, commute time, or open house date. Users can save multiple searches; so they don't have to commit to one neighborhood or price. Users can compare homes features easily; and schedule their open house visits with a calendar and map.

           <p>
            After an initial survey, I created a few different concepts for testing. I conducted user interviews with my own sketches and comparative analysis.  I established user personas, use-flows and wireframes for an initial concept. </p>

          <div class="container 2inline">
           <img class="image-responsive col-md-3" src="img/design/robin/usersuveys_personas2.png" />
           <img class="image-responsive col-md-8" src="img/design/robin/usestudies_3concepts.png" />
          </div>
          
          <p>
          We continued to gather data through typeform surveys and conducted card sorts to establish the most important home-features and app-features of our users.  I used this data and continued usability tests as I create multiple versions of wireframes and app concepts. 

          <div class="container 2inline">
           <img class="image-responsive col-md-8 col-md-offset-1" src="img/design/robin/robin_onboardingv1.png" />
           <img class="image-responsive col-md-8 col-md-offset-1" src="img/design/robin/robin_onboardingv4.png" />
          </div>

            <p>I utilized this qualitative data to complete the app on-boarding, navigation, wireframes, and a prototype. </p>

  Ela is an art cooperative, selling works for charity. My role was to design the ecommerce product, logo and branding for this new cooperative.

Timeline: 4 weeks

  With the initial concept in mind, I interviewed artists, fundraisers and potential buyers to establish user personas and a mental model of the product. I drew raw wireframes to get quick user reaction and feedback.  Armed with some new ideas and the user data, I spent about 3 weeks designing a responsive website, and concept for a tablet and mobile app. I created siteflows, navigation, and wireframes for the both the website and newsletters.  I then created the logo, branding ideas, and complete visual design of the responsive e-commerce site.

  Working directly with an entrepreneur wanting to solve a specific problem; I created the concept of Cook Clips.  Cook Clips is a cooking app that you can acutally use in the kitchen.

    I interviewed potential users about their cooking habits and app use in the kitchen, and developed a few key problems to solve. The personas varied greatly, and I first concentrated on a concept that meets one major use case.
